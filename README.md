# hugo_research
## Introduction
This repository contains the methodology and code for my research project made under supervision of Hugo Schyns.
## Selection
The "selection" part looks at historical data to determine which stocks will be included in further research. This list of stocks is stored in cusip_list.txt.
## Pre-processing
The "pre-processing" part look at the stocks from cusip_list.txt and processes them so that they can be read and more easily uderstood by the models in the next part.
## Modeling
The modeling part looks at the pre-processed data and tries to find forecasting patterns.
